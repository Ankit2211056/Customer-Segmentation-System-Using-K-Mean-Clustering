# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project groups customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.
It’s a simple but practical clustering project that helps understand unsupervised learning.

What I Did -

- Selected two features: Income and Spending Score
- Used the Elbow Method to decide the right number of clusters
- Applied K-Means to form groups
- Plotted clusters and centroids to understand customer behavior

What I Found -

- The dataset clearly forms around 5 customer groups, each showing different spending patterns.

Tech Used : 

- Python
- Pandas
-  Matplotlib
-  Seaborn
-  Scikit-learn

Why I Built This-

Clustering is used in marketing and retail. 
This project helped me understand how companies create customer segments.
